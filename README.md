# Bias and the Chicago Police Department

The goal of this project is to investigate the discrepancies in filing and
disciplining in the Chicago Police Department (CPD). Specifically, we are interested in why these 
discrepancies exist as well as any correlations between these discrepancies, 
an officer's future adverse encounters and biased policing. A detailed explanation of the
project's goals are outlined in the ProjectProposal.pdf and a summary of the final findings are located in 
FinalReport.pdf. 

In order to interact with the code, unzip the relevant checkpoints. Each checkpoint is complete with source code, a findings 
report, and a README.md file that explains how to run the source code. Here is an overview of the checkpoints:


    Checkpoint 1: Focuses on SQL Analytics to answer some preliminary questions
    Checkpoint 2: Focuses on the creation of some initial visualziations of the data using Tableau
    Checkpoint 3: Focuses on the creation of interactive visualizations using d3.js so we can examine
                  more than two dimensions at a time.
    Checkpoint 4: Uses graphical analysis algorithms and visualizations to analyze whether bad 
                  behavior is contagious among officers.
    Checkpoint 5: Uses NLP to run sentiment analysis on complaint reports to uncover potential biases.
